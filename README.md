# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with PyTorch + Gradio

This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** using **PyTorch**, and deploys an interactive demo using **Gradio**.  
You can upload an image and the model will predict which of the 10 CIFAR-10 classes it belongs to.
